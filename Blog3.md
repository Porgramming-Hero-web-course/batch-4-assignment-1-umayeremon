Type guards in TypeScript are used to enhance code safety, improve readability, and prevent runtime errors. They help verify types across various data structures. Below is a brief overview of some common type guards:

1. typeof Type Guard:

Used to check primitive types (e.g., string, number) using the typeof operator.


2. instanceof Type Guard:

Determines if an object is an instance of a specific class using instanceof.


3. Custom Type Guard:

For more complex structures, custom functions can serve as type guards.


4. in Operator:

Checks if a specific property exists in an object with the in operator.



In conclusion, type guards play a critical role in type checking, code safety, and error prevention, making TypeScript code more robust and reliable.
